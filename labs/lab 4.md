to make a ethernet cable you must have a crimper for ethernet 
first you strip the cord and inch down so yo have room for mistakes 
next you begin to line up the wires to have sriped orange, orange, striped green, blue, striped blue, green, striped brown and brown  4
then chech and make sure they are in the right areas then crimp it down and you have a ethernet cable this is for one way ethernet not where they send signels back and forth
