# Lab 1 — Troubleshooting Methodology

**Goal:** Practice the A+ flow: identify → theory → test → plan → verify → document.

**Scenario:** PC powers on, fans spin, but shows “No boot device available.”
did you move the computer? 
did you build this computer or did you buy it? 
did yo u ever change any hardware in the computer?
I make sure everything is plugged in by going to the hard drive and makeing sure it is plugged in 
if it doesnt change i make a boot-able drive to install a operating system 
and if that doesnt work you wall have to replace sata cord
